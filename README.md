# Machine-learning-fun

## creating own model
I wrote a little library to try out some neural network stuff. The library isn't optimazed and is written in JavaScript (Afterwards, I translated to python). It is just for fun and doesn't work well

## Poker

I use tensorflow basic stuff to try and learn to play poker.

> 6 - full house
> 5 - flush
> 4 - straight
> 3 - three of a kind
